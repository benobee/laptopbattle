<p>Laptop Battle’s initial success began in 2002 in Seattle, as one of the very first competitive computer music events.  With rabid success, the event expanded to cities all over the continental U.S. with offshoots as far as reaches of Bristol, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, and Japan.</p>  

<p>Over a decade since it’s flamboyant beginnings, much ground remains to be covered in the realm of computer music performance, and we aim to cover it.</p>

<h2>Join the Battle</h2>
<p>We aim to create a platform that allows talented artists to rise to the top. The music industry is a hob knob circus full of social engineering and plastic people.</p>

<p>Our goal is to help artists forge a pathway and gain skill, appreciation, recognition, audience, and feedback through the platform.</p>

<p>Anyone can submit a video to enter the monthly competition or participate on the website. There’s several ways to build points across the system, such as submitting videos for the monthly battle, leaving feedback/comments, challenging and winning head-to-head battles.</p>

<p>To learn more about the competition, check out the rules.</p>
